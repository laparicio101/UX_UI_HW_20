        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>We discovered that pet owners get stressed when they forget their pet's wellness information. 
                Oftentimes, the pet's medical records get lost and the communication with other caretakes become ineffecient. This leads to an overlap of grooming and medical appointments, 
                inconsistent feeding schedules, and overall stress in the caring of the pet's well-being. 
                </p>

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>The solution was to create a pet mobile app that not only keeps track of medical appointments, 
            but also has the ability of inviting another caretaker so everyone is up to date with feeding schedules,
            medical appointments/records, etc.

            <h6>User Research</h6>
            <p>During our user research phase, our goal was to learn how people currently keep track of their pet's wellness. 
                In order to find out more details on this, we conducted 5 remote interviews and 1 survey that resulted in 29 
                responses. After conducting the interviews and survey, we analazyed the data by creating an affinity diagram
                which later helped us identify our user persona, Gabby Smith.
