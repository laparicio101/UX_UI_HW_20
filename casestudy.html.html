        <p class="lead">Busy pet owners often face frustrations when keeping track of their pet’s wellness. They need a solution that can 
            help them get more organized with managing their pet’s documents and appointments. Our goal was to improve the pet’s 
            caretaking experience so that busy pet owners can relax and have an enjoyable time and deeper connection with their pets and family.

        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>The Problem: </h2>
            <p>We discovered that pet owners get stressed when they forget their pet's wellness information. 
                Oftentimes, the pet's medical records get lost and the communication with other caretakes become ineffecient. This leads to an overlap of grooming and medical appointments, 
                inconsistent feeding schedules, and overall stress in the caring of the pet's well-being. 
            </p>

        

        
            <h3>The Solution:</h3>
            <p>The solution was to create a pet mobile app that not only keeps track of medical appointments, 
                but also has the ability of inviting another caretaker so everyone is up to date with feeding schedules,
             medical appointments/records, etc. 
            </p>

            <h6>Phase 1: User Research</h6>
            <p>During our user research phase, our goal was to learn how people currently keep track of their pet's wellness. 
                In order to find out more details on this, we conducted 5 remote interviews and 1 survey that resulted in 29 
                responses. After conducting the interviews and survey, we analazyed the data by creating an affinity diagram
                which later helped us identify our user persona, Gabby Smith.

        <h7>Phase 2: Definition and Synthesis</h7>
        <div>
            <p>After knowing what challenges and goals Gabby faced, we came up with our user Insight and problem 
                statement which helped us develop a better understanding of our user and to validate some of our ideas.  
            </p>

        <div>
            <h8>User Insight</h8>
            <p>Gabby, a young pet lover,  gets stressed when forgetting about her pet’s wellness information. 
                Her husband offers to help her but he does not know what services need to be booked since the 
                records are disorganized. Gabby worries that they may overlap the appointments, feeding and 
                medication schedules which could cause a problem in their pet’s health. Gabby needs a better way 
                to communicate with her husband and store their pet’s records. This will ensure that their pet 
                stays healthy and she can be more relaxed and have a more enjoyable time with her family and pets. 
            </p>

            <h9>Problem Statement</h9>
            <p>During interviews, we discovered that pet owners get stressed when forgetting important pet’s 
                wellness information. Oftentimes the pet’s medical records get lost and the communication 
                with other pet caretakers is inefficient, which leads to forgetting medical and grooming 
                appointments, inconsistent feeding and medication schedules, frustration and misunderstandings. 
                We observed pet owners need a better way to communicate and share pet’s care information, keep track
                of appointments and store pet’s records. We observed that without an alternative, pet owners rely on
                memory, vet’s reminders, calendar notifications and paper trail.  
            </p>

            <p>How might we improve the pet wellness and caretaking experience so that pet owners can be more 
                relaxed, have a more enjoyable time and deeper connection with their pets and family?</p>

            <p>During the ideation phase, we started off with the I like, I wish, What if method where we 
                organized the information that our interviews gave us which will later help us in creating 
                the key features of our app. We found our key features by creating a Priortization Matrix. 
                Some of them were:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Having an interface that allows pet owners to share their pet's information with other caretakers. </li>
                <li> Digitially storing their pet's records and paperwork. </li>
